Instructions:

You need Scala 2.9.0 or higher to compile and run the code.

Run /src/plan/Main to run the planner.
Run /src/gui/BasicSwing to run the version with a UI.

The Unit Test stuff under /src/test requires the scala-test library.
The GUI (/src/test) requires the JGraphX java library.
Both libraries can be downloaded freely from the Internet. If you do not have these libraries, 
the two folders can be safely deleted without affecting the main functionality.
