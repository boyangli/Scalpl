Instructions:

You need Scala 2.9.0 or higher to compile and run the code.

Run /src/plan/Main to run the planner.
Run /src/gui/BasicSwing to run the version with a UI.

The Unit Test stuff under /src/test requires the scala-test library.
The GUI (/src/test) requires the JGraphX java library.
If you do not have these libraries, you can delete the two folders. It would not affect the main functionality.
